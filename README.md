I am a software developer with extensive focus in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. With my background as a former teacher, I am able to analyze and deconstruct problems by seeing them all as learning opportunities to grow from. My interest in web development aligns closely with my former profession because I find great artistry in finding new ways to help educate both myself and my peers on complex subjects.

Outside of my profession, you can usually catch me reading, watching films, or just enjoying the company of close friends. Feel free to reach out with any questions!
